# YouTube Extension


## Build

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run package:windows` or `npm run package:linux` depending on your os
3. add the folder `dist` as unpacked extension to your browser


## Develop

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run dev:windows` or `npm run dev:linux` depending on your os
3. add the folder `devDist` as unpacked extension to your browser

This creates a simple extension with loads the actual files from the webpack server. So you don't have to reload the extension after each change.


## Ideas

- record watch time
- create config site
- disable video state buttons while applying
- show Thumbnail of current video above recommanded list
- show if video is open in other tab
